> There are 60 seconds in a minute
> There are 60 minutes in an hour
> There are 24 hours in a day
> There are 7 days in a week
> That means there are:
> 3600 seconds in an hour,
> 86400 seconds in an day,
> 604800 seconds in a week
> That means when you turn 20, you've been alive for 628992000 seconds, 
> and if you make it to 100, you will have lived 3144960000 seconds. Make them count!

NOTE: Please use descriptive variable names and calculate these values, i.e. the following is not valid for this assignment:
